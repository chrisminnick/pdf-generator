# Code Block Formatting Fix - Summary

## Problem Identified

The converted Advanced React course had code blocks that were only indented (with 4 spaces) instead of being properly formatted with markdown code fencing. This caused:

- Poor rendering in the PDF
- Missing syntax highlighting
- Improper code formatting in the table of contents

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Comprehensive Code Block Fixer

**Script**: `fix-all-code-blocks.py`

- Detects indented code blocks (4-space indentation)
- Identifies code by checking for programming constructs (brackets, semicolons, keywords)
- Converts to proper markdown code fencing with ````javascript`
- Handles both single lines and multi-line code blocks
- Preserves empty lines within code blocks

### 2. Fixed Both Slides and Labs

**Files processed**:

- `advanced-react-slides-v1.0.0/advanced_react.md` ✅
- All lab files in `advanced-react-labs-v1.0.0/` ✅
  - lab01.md through lab05.md
  - README.md
  - title-page.md

### 3. Updated Course Converter

Enhanced `convert-course.js` to automatically fix code blocks in future conversions:

- Added `fixCodeBlocks()` method to `postProcessSlides()`
- Automatic detection and conversion of indented code
- Ensures all future PPTX/DOCX conversions have proper code formatting

## Results

### Before Fix:

```
    import { redirect } from 'react-router-dom';
    const loader = async () => {
    const user = await getUser();
```

### After Fix:

````markdown
```javascript
import { redirect } from 'react-router-dom';
const loader = async () => {
const user = await getUser();
```
````

### Build Results:

- ✅ **Build successful**: PDF generation works correctly
- ✅ **Code highlighting**: Proper syntax highlighting in generated PDFs
- ✅ **File sizes maintained**: Slides PDF still 0.9MB with 109 sections
- ✅ **Labs PDF**: 0.3MB with 5 sections, all with proper code formatting
- ✅ **HTML output**: Shows `<pre><code class="language-javascript">` tags

## Verification

1. **PDF TOC**: Code blocks no longer appear as malformed text in table of contents
2. **HTML output**: Proper `<code>` tags with language classes
3. **Syntax highlighting**: JavaScript code properly highlighted
4. **Readability**: Code blocks now have proper formatting and spacing

## Future Benefits

- All future course conversions will automatically have proper code formatting
- No manual intervention needed for code block formatting
- Consistent code presentation across all courses
- Better learning experience for students

✅ **Status**: Complete - Advanced React course now has properly formatted code blocks in both slides and labs!
